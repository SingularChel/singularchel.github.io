With Facebook continually being adamant about [exploiting](https://outline.com/3UN2wn) their users as a way to profit, I have decided to try to discontinue using the service yet again as of today. I know, I know, "but you always come back!" Yeah, I always do. And even now, I only deactivated my account as I still need to be able to use Messenger.

I typically have this mindset: "These companies already have my data, so the damage has already been done." This justified my usage of such things like Google, Facebook, or Microsoft Windows. But I've begun trying to change my usage of these things based on the principles I believe in.

## History always repeats itself.

I am slowly migrating over to transparent, open platforms. I discontinued using Google Chrome (and any other Chromium-based web browsers) because I disagree with the direction Google is taking with the project. The web needs to be an open platform that isn't dominated by one browser or rendering engine. This brings to mind the browser wars of the 2000s, where Microsoft's Internet Explorer dominated the web. Broken, non-compliant code was prevalent because it catered to Internet Explorer. Many sites were broken in standards-compliant web browsers like Mozilla's Firefox, because they didn't support proprietary technologies pushed by Microsoft in their browser. It was a rather dark time for the web; the world's most used web browser was riddled with security issues and promoted a more closed web.

Thankfully, in the 2010s, we started moving away from this. I'll even say that we completely moved past it. But with the news that Google is intentionally breaking websites for non-Chromium browsers, I fear that we will be returning to the ways of the past. This worries me because [Microsoft has decided to abandon EdgeHTML and rebase their browser on Chromium](https://outline.com/cZRZcX). This doesn't bode well for the open web. I believe that we are headed for a time where the mistakes of the past will be repeated. This isn't a good thing.

## I'll do my part.

With that, I'll try to do my part to stop using platforms that do not promote transparency or security. I cannot in good conscience support these kind of platforms any longer.
