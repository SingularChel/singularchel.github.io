# singular chel

Hi. I am Chel. I am a taco. I am a non-binary/genderflux person and my pronouns are singular 'they' (they/them/theirs). This is where I plan to dump my random musings about life and stuff. If you're here, you probably already know who I am.

Interests: Video games (Nintendo, mobile, Steam/PC gaming, retro), music (EDM, punk rock, metal), food (anything that tastes good or is spicy), travel, technology (mobile computing, operating systems, open source), mental health
